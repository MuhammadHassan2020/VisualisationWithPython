## Introduction

In this project, we explore **data visualization techniques** using Seaborn and Matplotlib to analyze datasets and present insights through charts and plots. The project covers topics such as:

- Data distribution visualization (histograms, joint plots, pair plots).
- Categorical data visualization (bar plots, violin plots, swarm plots).
- Advanced plotting techniques such as heatmaps and subplots.

The datasets used in the project are sourced from real-world scenarios, such as restaurant tips and random matrices, to better understand visualization techniques.

## Getting Started

To explore the visualizations, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries using the provided instructions.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks and execute the cells to visualize the data.
3. Modify and experiment with the code to customize plots.

## Seaborn Visualizations

Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for statistical graphics.

### Key Features Demonstrated:

1. **Distribution Plots:**
   - `sns.displot()` – To visualize data distribution with histograms and density estimation.
   - `sns.jointplot()` – To analyze relationships between two numerical variables.

2. **Categorical Plots:**
   - `sns.barplot()` – To compare categorical data distributions.
   - `sns.boxplot()` – To analyze quartiles and detect outliers.
   - `sns.violinplot()` – A combination of box plot and density plot.

3. **Pair Plots:**
   - `sns.pairplot()` – To visualize pairwise relationships across numerical variables.

4. **Heatmaps:**
   - `sns.heatmap()` – To visualize matrix correlations and highlight data patterns.

## Matplotlib Visualizations

Matplotlib is a low-level plotting library that offers great flexibility for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

### Key Features Demonstrated:

1. **Basic Plotting:**
   - `plt.plot()` – To create line plots with various styles and markers.

2. **Customization:**
   - Adding titles and labels with `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()`, and `plt.title()`.
   - Tuning graph styles using colors, markers, and line styles.

3. **Subplots:**
   - `plt.subplot()` – To create multiple plots on the same figure.
   - `plt.subplots()` – To define layouts with multiple axes.

4. **Figure Customization:**
   - Creating complex layouts with multiple axes for better visualization.
